	help
	  Say Y here if you want to dump the kernel virtual memory layout to
	  dmesg log on boot up. This information is only useful for kernel
	  developers who are working in architecture specific areas of the
	  kernel. It is probably not a good idea to enable this feature in a
	  production kernel.
